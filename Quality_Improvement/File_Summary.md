📄 Reference: 
Quality Control Individu 2023

🎯 Theme
Reducing deviation frequency between DAR (Raw Daily) and DAR (Raw MTD) data by implementing an integrated Data Lake architecture between Head Office and Site Project.

🚩 Problem
- High deviation frequency in Working Hours (WH) data
- Data sent via email → revision not tracked
- No centralized database
- Inconsistent reporting between HO and Site

💡 Solution
- Implemented Hybrid Data Lake Architecture (Offline + Cloud)
- Integrated data between Head Office and Site
- Automated data transformation & consolidation
- Reduced data storage cost using Parquet format

📈 Impact
- Deviation frequency reduced to 0 within 2 months
- Improved decision-making reliability
- Reduced data storage cost by 87%+
- Improved QCDSM aspects (Quality, Cost, Delivery, Safety, Morale)

🏆 2024 – ROBOLCESH (Automation & RPA Innovation)

📄 Reference: 
Quality Control Individu 2024

🎯 Theme
Eliminating daily workload overload in Dispatch-OCR team by 47% through system automation.

🚩 Problem
- Manual processing of VHMS data every hour
- Workload utilization reached 103% per hour
- Risk of adding manpower (from 3 to 5 people)
- Potential cost increase: Rp 360,000,000 (3 years)

💡 Solution
Developed ROBOLCESH (Robotic Business Operation Less Code to Effective System Hybrid):
- Hybrid local-to-cloud automation
- Low-code robotic process automation (RPA)
- Automated data ingestion every 20 minutes
- Python scheduler & system orchestration

📈 Impact

📄 Reference: 
Quality Control Individu 2025

🎯 Theme
Increasing data governance lifecycle frequency from 10x/week to 672x/week using Governance Lite concept based on DAMA DMBOK.

🚩 Problem
- Manual data processing (150 minutes/day)
- 31.25% working time spent on administrative tasks
- High duplication & error risk
- Annual inefficiency cost: Rp 33,750,000

💡 Solution
- Implemented Governance Lite Framework
- Automated data refresh & integration
- Defined SOP & data quality KPI
- Applied DAMA DMBOK principles (Data Storage, Integration, Quality)

📈 Impact
- Data lifecycle refresh increased from 10x → 672x per week
- Process time reduced from 150 min → 30 min per day
- Cost reduction: 64.44% annually
- Error rate ≤ 0%
- Productivity increased by 188%

Strategic time allocation improved
